				<li>Growing up as an Armenian-American and attending an Armenian church, I was surrounded by liturgical chants and folk music from Armenian culture. I fell in love with the unique textures and styles in Armenian music.</li>
				<li>My goal is to continue exploring folk music of Armenia and other ethnicities and share my passion for this music with the world!</li>

				<li>I love the “Armenian Miniatures” by Komitas, arranged for string quartet by Sergei Aslamazyan (see the folk music section).</li>
				<li>There is also a special place in my heart for Komitas’s arrangement of the “Patarag” as I grew up hearing and singing these melodies in my church.</li>

				<li>This is definitely not a comprehensive list of Armenian music! There are other wonderful genres like jazz, and modern/pop music and many other composers that have not been mentioned.</li>
				<li>I chose these genres because they are the most familiar to me from my childhood, but they are only a taste of all the wonderful Armenian music out there!</li>
